## Topic Generation Exercise

### The goal of these next exercises is to find your expertise- You should have a worksheet (separate handout) with 3 pages of topic brainstorming idea.- You’ll have 2 minutes to look over everything.- Then you’ll have 3 minutes to write down as much as you can, in whatever boxes speak to you- After this exercise, you’ll be handing this to a partner, who will use this to ask questions to further findyour expertise.- You don’t need to fill out everything ­­ just fill in the topics, projects, bugs, languages, etc that come tomind the easiest.- Star or circle anything you’d like to be asked about later.### Things to keep in mind when brainstorming for talk topics- Conferences are always looking for new perspectives- Many talks are aimed at novice or intermediate level- What interests you? (some of the best talks are “related” or “fringe” topics)- YOU are the expert on how YOU use a set of tools/frameworks
## “Speak” DateYou’ve started thinking about topics to speak about, now you’ll find a pair, interview each other and explore the brainstorm ideas further:- For this next exercise, you’ll find a pair- You’ll have 15 minutes for the interview and discussion (~ 10 minutes for the interview and 5 minutesfor discussion)- You’ll use your partner’s filled­ in worksheet to guide your interview- As an interviewer, your goal is to come up with 3 potential topics your partner could speak aboutYou need:
- Notebook- Topic Generation WorksheetInstructions:
1. Exchange topic generation worksheets2. Partner #1 Interviews Partner #23. Partner #1 suggests topics for Partner #2 and they discuss4. Partner #2 interviews Partner #15. Partner #2 suggests topics for Partner #1 and they discussSample interview questions:
- Tell me about ... (one of the bubbles they filled out in the topic generation worksheet)- What project/feature/bug are you currently working on?- What was the best talk/screencast/video you’ve watched recently?- What do you want to learn?- What could you teach me about?
## How to Write a Talk ProposalBefore working on your own talk proposals, let’s take a step back to look and review a few actual conference proposals

- On the next few pages are sample proposals- You’ll have 5 minutes to go through them and write down your thoughts- Quickly pick one with your partner ­­ you can review the rest later- Then you’ll discuss with you pair from the “speak” date exercise aboveWhat you’ll be looking for while reviewing these proposals:- What is this talk about?- Does it have enough relevance to the conference attendees? (“What’s in it for me?”)- Will this talk fit in the allotted time frame?- Has this person thought through all the points they want to make?- Do you want to see this talk?Instructions:
1. Stay in your pairs2. Choose 1 talk proposal quickly3. Read proposal and write your thoughts4. Discuss proposal
What makes up a talk proposal:- Title  - Get people interested and excited  - Be vague enough that you have wiggle room when creating your presentation  - Be specific enough that readers know what you’re talking about- Description  - What’s the main idea? What are some sub­-topics? What’s the conclusion?  - Some people include bullet points with a rough outline of the talk  - Keep people interested  - Be vague and specific :)  - Show the reviewer that your talk has substance- Abstract (sometimes)  - Extended description- Reviewers notes (sometimes)  - Extended description with a focus on why you’re qualified to do this talk or why it’s particularlyimportant- Bio  - Tell the reviewer about yourself and why you’re qualified to give this talk  - Being qualified can be “I’m learning too!”- Video (sometimes)  - Can be a video of you presenting at a conference, meeting, or Meetup  - Or can be a video of you doing a lightning talk to your webcam
## Example Talk Proposals
### Proposal #1**You Can't Miss What You Can't Measure****Description**:Adrift at sea, a GPS device will report your precise latitude and longitude, but if you don't know what those numbers mean, you're just as lost as before. Similarly, there are many tools that offer a wide variety of metrics about your code, but other than making you feel good, what are you supposed to do with this knowledge? Let's answer that question by exploring what the numbers mean, how static code analysis can add value to your development process, and how it can help us chart the unexplored seas of legacy code.**Reviewers Notes**:Lately, it seems like "code metrics" for many people means running their project through Code Climate and saying "awesome! A couple D's, but otherwise I rock!" and then moving on to the next project. I spend a lot of time working with legacy code /and/ doing freelance greenfield development, and have found code metrics to be a strong tool when made part of my iterative, TDD process. They can act as rumble strips along the highway, alerting us when our code starts to drift into oncoming traffic.. but you have to know what the numbers mean, which ones to pay attention to, and how to add them to your process with a minimum of ceremony or fuss.**Accepted**: Yes**Type(s) of Conferences**: Regional, Language­specific, Multiple
**Categories**: Technical, About a technique
### Proposal #2**PiDoorbell - Instantaneous Video Notifications with Arduino and RaspberryPi****Description**:Arduino’s and RaspberryPi’s are the new frontier in enabling regular developers like you and me get access to an affordable and easy­-to-­program platform to build cool things. In this talk, I will present how to use Arduino’s, RaspberryPi’s and your smartphone to be notified of an event that you want to know about – whether you’re at home, work or a conference halfway across the world.The talk will include a brief overview of Arduino, RaspberryPi and my setup (proximity sensor, camera and other hardware). I will then present how I built the initial gadget and then tied it into my smartphone that will notify me of an event happening along with a video snippet of activity at the front door.Finally, I will wrap up with a live demo of the project and Q&A, if possible. In the interests of time, I could show a video of the project working in real life (2­3 min) instead.**Abstract**:Have you ever found yourself obsessively checking the UPS or FedEx tracking site to see if your package finally got delivered at your doorstep? Or wondered when your contractor/gardener showed up to do their job? Or if your neighbor came looking for you on an urgent matter while you were out?In this talk, I will show you how you can relax and rely on your handy­-dandy smartphone to let you know when these events happen along with video snippets of what happened and who showed up!**Accepted**: Yes**Categories**: Technical, Workshop, About a technology￼
### Proposal #3**The Second Step: HOWTO encourage open source work at for-profits****Description**:Even at pro­-FLOSS businesses, logistical obstacles and incentive problems get in the way of giving back. I'll show you how to fix that.**Abstract**:You might not even realize what obstacles are blocking your colleagues from efficiently collaborating with FLOSS projects. In this presentation, you’ll learn how to take the next step in encouraging employees to contribute to FLOSS, with specific recommendations for fixing these issues.I’ll introduce tools you can use, such as:- tuned employee performance criteria and appraisals- FLOSS­-friendly project management strategies- sneaky-­yet-­sensible PRI’ll mine my experience as lead project manager and personnel manager at Collabora for examples. And I want to hear your experience and suggestions, too — for example, can FLOSS leaders help with tactics like sensible copyright assignment policies?
**Accepted**: Yes
**Type(s) of Conferences**: National, Open source

### Proposal #4

**Sassy! Stylesheets with SCSS**

**Description**:
If you’ve ever wished for more readable and maintainable CSS, SCSS (the current version of Sass) is the tool you’ve been waiting for. SCSS builds upon CSS3 to add features such as reusable variables and blocks, functions for manipulating colors and doing mathematical operations, selector nesting, and style inheritance. Before deploying, you simply compile yourSCSS into ordinary CSS files in one easy (and easily automated) step. This session will present the core features of SCSS with helpful examples, and get you excited about writing CSS again.**Accepted**: Yes
**Type(s) of Conference**: Regional, General 
**Categories**: Technical, About a technology
### Proposal #5
**REST for Web Developers**
**Description**:
REST is a term filled with hype and promise, but is it anything more than JSON and pretty URLs? This session tells you everything you need to know about working with REST and implementing it yourself, with a quick tour through verbs, headers, status codes and content types. There will be real examples of making requests using different verbs and data formats, and how to cope when things go wrong (it happens, even in REST!). Expect lots of examples and practical advice in this session that will help developers, architects and technical leads alike.**Accepted**: Yes**Type(s) of Conference**: Local User Group, National + Language­-specific, National + General
**Categories**: Technical
### Proposal #6**Pains and Gains of PHP Upgrades**
**Description**:
What version of PHP are you running? PHP 5.3? PHP 5.4? PHP 5.2? Most of us lag behind the "new shiny", but at some point you'll face both the pain of the upgrade migration and the joy of the new features and performance improvements. Whether it's your boss or your distro that holds you back, this session covers what to expect with each upgrade. You willfind out about the excellent new features and how to use them, and also get practical, hands-­on information about performing a successful upgrade.**Accepted**: Yes**Type(s) of Conference**: National + Language­-specific, National + General
**Categories**: Technical
### Proposal #7**Five Tools For Better PHP Development****Description**:We hear so much about the PHP code ­ but what about the tools that will help the speed and quality of the rest of the development process? This talk runs through five tools that will improve the way you develop, making life easier for you and your team, and letting you spend more time on the interesting bits of the projects. We'll look at deploying sites with phing, static analysis packages such as php code sniffer and phpdoc, and how to keep an eye on applications after they've gonelive using monitoring systems and supervisord. If you have a place in directing the improvement of development processes in your team, then this session is for you.**Accepted**: Yes**Type(s) of Conference**: National + Language­specific, National + General
**Categories**: Technical
### Proposal #8**A House of Cards - The Perils of Maintaining a 7-Year-Old Codebase****Description**:With ruby on rails, often the focus is on how easy it is to build an application from the ground up. But, there is a whole different set of challenges when working on a mature application.This talk will discuss the issues discovered when working with a 7­-year-­old pile of code. In the beginning, the question isn’t “How do I build this,” but more like “Where does this go” or “Where is this bug coming from.” I will discuss the sometimes unintended consequences of introducing new features, tracking down and fixing ancient bugs, estimating the time a new feature will take given the many other peculiar surprises you will uncover, and finally how not to worry about the inevitable day when you will break everything.The audience will hear from a developer who works with old code every day and a tips to make their future selves and successors less confused, more productive, and less unintentionally destructive.**Accepted**: Yes**Type(s) of Conference**: Regional + Language­-specific
**Categories**: Big Picture
### Proposal #9**Taking Ruby Community in India to a new level****Description**:So you are here at the only ruby conference in India, and have the following questions running through your mind:
- How come there aren't more events like this in India where I can meet fellow ruby enthusiasts across the nation on a more frequent basis?
- In fact, why isn't there an active ruby community in my home town? Why can't someone organize regular meetings so that I can get an opportunity to meet other local ruby developers in person and learn from them on a regular basis?
- How would it be if every major city in India have a size­-able ruby & rails community solving real­-world problems in the local community and creating job opportunities galore for the local developers?Fear not!This talk will address all that and more, while exploring the numerous ways in which you ­ yes, you who are reading this ­ can contribute towards making the Ruby community in India to scale new heights, irrespective of how long you have been programming in ruby.Bring your community building hat, and explore with me the beautiful future we could create together for the Indian ruby community!**Accepted**: Yes**Type(s) of Conference**: National + Language-specific
**Categories**: Big Picture, Community building### Proposal #10**The JavaScript Interpreter, Interpreted****Description**:JavaScript is misunderstood. It looks like C, acts like Lisp, but deviates in important and confusing ways. It can mimic classical behavior but is built on prototypes. It has blocks but doesn’t provide block scope. Then, throw in the magical “this” keyword and we have a recipe for interpreted disaster.
Understanding how JavaScript creates and executes function objects is key to understanding JavaScript. In this talk we'll walk through the JavaScript interpreter in an easy-­to-­follow no­-confusing-­jargon manner. You'll leave with a better understanding of how vanilla JavaScript works from the inside out!
**Abstract**:JavaScript differs from other languages in confusing and important ways. But, if you understand how the JS interpreter creates and executes function objects, you can understand JS in a deeper way. Join Martha to learn more about how vanilla JavaScript works from the inside out!**Accepted**: Yes**Type(s) of Conference**: Local User Group, National + Language­-specific, Region + General
**Categories**: Big Picture, Community building
